        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Comake is revolutionizing democracy. We are bringing ultimate
          transparency, accountability and ownership to how taxpayer money is
          spent at a local level. We allow taxpayers to decide how their local
          taxes are spent by giving them the ability to allocate funding to
          issues they care about or problems they want solved.
